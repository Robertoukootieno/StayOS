  description: "# Noventrix StayOS - Comprehensive Hospitality Management API\n\n\
    **Version:** 1.0.0  \n**Status:** Production Ready  \n**Last Updated:** 2025-12-18\n\
    \n## Overview\n\nStayOS provides a complete RESTful API for hospitality management,\
    \ covering:\n- Property & Inventory Management\n- Reservation & Booking Lifecycle\n\
    - Guest Profiles & Loyalty\n- Operations (Housekeeping & Maintenance)\n- Billing\
    \ & Payments\n- Compliance & Audit\n- Channel Management & Distribution\n\n##\
    \ Architecture Principles\n\n- **RESTful Design:** Resource-oriented URLs, HTTP\
    \ verbs, standard status codes\n- **HATEOAS:** Hypermedia links for discoverability\n\
    - **Idempotency:** Safe retries using idempotency keys\n- **Versioning:** URL-based\
    \ versioning (/v1/, /v2/)\n- **Pagination:** Cursor-based for large datasets\n\
    - **Filtering:** Rich query parameters following JSON:API conventions\n- **Rate\
    \ Limiting:** Token bucket algorithm (100 req/min standard, 1000 req/min premium)\n\
    \n## Authentication & Security\n\n- **OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect** for user authentication\n\
    - **API Keys** for server-to-server integration\n- **JWT Bearer Tokens** with\
    \ short expiry (15 minutes)\n- **Refresh Tokens** for session management\n- **Scopes**\
    \ for fine-grained authorization\n- **mTLS** for high-security integrations\n\n\
    ## Error Handling\n\nAll errors follow RFC 7807 (Problem Details for HTTP APIs):\n\
    ```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"https://api.stayos.com/errors/validation-error\",\n\
    \  \"title\": \"Validation Failed\",\n  \"status\": 400,\n  \"detail\": \"Check-out\
    \ date must be after check-in date\",\n  \"instance\": \"/reservations/create\"\
    ,\n  \"traceId\": \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\",\n  \"errors\": [\n\
    \    {\n      \"field\": \"checkOutDate\",\n      \"code\": \"INVALID_DATE_RANGE\"\
    ,\n      \"message\": \"Check-out date must be after check-in date\"\n    }\n\
    \  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\n- **Header:** `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`,\
    \ `X-RateLimit-Reset`\n- **Status Code:** 429 Too Many Requests\n- **Retry-After:**\
    \ Seconds until rate limit resets\n\n## Webhooks\n\nStayOS supports webhooks for\
    \ real-time event notifications. See `/webhooks` endpoints.\n\n## Support\n\n\
